    "Windows Remarks:\n",
    "- Git provides a usable Bash shell after installation\n",
    "- Microsoft provides an integrated Linux subsystem through it's [store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4MSV6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash Remarks:\n",
    "- Most commands in bash work in the format: <command name\\> [sub commands] [-options] [...parameters]\n",
    "- Whenever in doubt of how a command exactly works, most have a manual page with details about options and specific parameter patterns. You can access the manual page by runing \"man <command name\\>\", i.e. \"man ls\". Some commands have similar names and may require a number after the command name to access the correct manual page.\n",
    "- Bash provides pipe like operators by default, these include \">>\", \">\" and \"|\".\n",
    "- Bash is a great tool for scripting so you can make the most of the operators mentioned in the point above to make complex operations using more than one command to get from input to output and do a series of commands all in a row using the \";\" operator.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step in using git is creating a repository. The concept of repository is just like a file system, very similiar to the one you have in your own computer. The special thing about git repositories is that they contain some extra information in a folder named \".git\" that will allow us to do a lot more and a lot easier than what we could with a regular file system. To experience this difference let's create a new folder and initiate an empty repository inside it."
