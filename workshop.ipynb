    "\n",
    "In this workshop we will learn the basic functionalities of Git and how these can improve our team workflow.\n",
    "Most of this workshop will be conducted using a bash shell and as such some basic command line usage will also be shown and explained.\n",

    "\n",
    "Windows Remarks:\n",
    "- Git provides a usable Bash shell after installation\n",
    "- Microsoft provides an integrated Linux subsystem through it's [store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4MSV6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash Remarks:\n",
    "- Most commands in bash work in the format: <command name\\> [sub commands] [-options] [...parameters]\n",
    "- Whenever in doubt of how a command exactly works, most have a manual page with details about options and specific parameter patterns. You can access the manual page by runing \"man <command name\\>\", i.e. \"man ls\". Some commands have similar names and may require a number after the command name to access the correct manual page.\n",
    "- Bash provides pipe like operators by default, these include \">>\", \">\" and \"|\".\n",
    "- Bash is a great tool for scripting so you can make the most of the operators mentioned in the point above to make complex operations using more than one command to get from input to output and do a series of commands all in a row using the \";\" operator.\n",

    "### 1 - Creating a Repository \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in using git is creating a repository. The concept of repository is just like a file system, very similiar to the one you have in your own computer. The special thing about git repositories is that they contain some extra information in a folder named \".git\" that will allow us to do a lot more and a lot easier than what we could with a regular file system. To experience this difference let's create a new folder and initiate an empty repository inside it."

The working tree is the local file system part that's included in our git repository and the staging area is an abstraction of git that represents the changes when executing a `commit` command. The `-A` option stands for _all_ and means all changes in the working tree are added to the staging area. Although useful, don't make a habit of using the `-A` option.\n",

    "**`git commit`** - As the name implies, we are commiting to a change we made to the repository. Once you *commit*, the state of the repository will be registered and you can always restore it or check differences to the current state. Commits can be deleted but its not something you do on a regular basis as it's usualy easier to fix something rather than redoing everything else. The `-m` lets you add a message to your commit, these should usualy follow a protocol that lets you quicky understand what's beed added removed or modified with that commit.\n",

    "- `--oneline` view each commit as a single line;\n",

This is a security risk in case anyone gets access to the .git directory. Secret information should be kept in a separate directory to the rest of the code and online platforms often offer support for secrets to be safely shared between developers."
